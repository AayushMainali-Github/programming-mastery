// Fundamentals
// Introduction to C++: Overview of C++ history, its evolution, and its significance in modern programming.
// Setting Up the C++ Environment: Installing compilers, IDEs, and build tools for C++ development.
// Basic Syntax and Structure: Writing your first "Hello, World!" program, understanding the main function, and program layout.
// Variables and Data Types: Exploring primitive data types, constants, and type modifiers in C++.
// Operators and Expressions: Using arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators to form expressions.
// Control Flow Statements: Implementing conditionals (if, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) for flow control.
// Functions: Defining and invoking functions with parameter types, return types, and function prototypes.
// Arrays and Strings: Declaring, initializing, and manipulating arrays and both C-style and std::string strings.
// Pointers: Understanding pointers, pointer arithmetic, and how they reference memory locations.
// References and Const Qualifiers: Using references to alias variables and enforcing immutability with the const keyword.
// Dynamic Memory Management: Allocating and deallocating memory with new and delete; an introduction to smart pointers.
// Structures, Unions, and Enumerations: Defining composite types to group related data and creating enumerated constants.
// Input/Output in C++: Working with standard I/O streams (cin, cout) and basic file I/O operations.
// Basic Error Handling: Simple error reporting using error codes and an introduction to exception handling in C++.
// Intermediate
// Object-Oriented Programming in C++: Building classes and objects, and understanding encapsulation and abstraction.
// Constructors, Destructors, and Function Overloading: Managing object lifecycles and overloading functions for polymorphic behavior.
// Inheritance and Polymorphism: Extending classes through inheritance and using virtual functions for dynamic polymorphism.
// Operator Overloading: Customizing operators (e.g., +, -, <<) to work with user-defined types.
// Templates: Creating generic functions and classes to write reusable, type-safe code.
// Advanced Exception Handling: Utilizing try/catch blocks, throwing custom exceptions, and ensuring robust error management.
// Standard Template Library (STL) Fundamentals: An introduction to vectors, lists, maps, sets, and other STL containers.
// Iterators and STL Algorithms: Using iterators to traverse containers and applying built-in algorithms for data manipulation.
// Lambda Expressions: Writing concise, inline anonymous functions for functional programming patterns.
// Smart Pointers and RAII: Managing dynamic memory safely using std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and the RAII paradigm.
// Namespaces and Modularization: Organizing code into logical groups to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.
// Advanced File I/O: Utilizing fstream, stringstream, and error handling to work with files effectively.
// Multithreading and Concurrency: Introduction to C++ threading, synchronization mechanisms, and concurrent programming patterns.
// Modern C++ Features (C++11/14/17/20): Exploring language enhancements like auto, range-based loops, smart pointers, and structured bindings.
// Debugging and Profiling Techniques: Tools and strategies for identifying performance bottlenecks and debugging C++ applications.
// Capstone Project: Integrating all learned concepts to build a comprehensive, real-world C++ application.
