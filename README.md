# Programming Mastery

## Overview
**Programming Mastery** is an educational platform designed to provide a comprehensive learning experience for programming enthusiasts. It covers multiple programming languages, focusing on both fundamental and intermediate topics, allowing learners to build a strong foundation and advance their skills. The platform features structured lessons, interactive content, and practical examples to guide learners at every step.

Each course is divided into chapters with clear explanations, code examples, and best practices to reinforce learning.

## Features
- **Interactive Lessons**: Each chapter includes theoretical explanations, code snippets, and practical examples to facilitate a deeper understanding of the topic.
- **Modular Structure**: The platform is built with React components, making it easy to add new courses or chapters and customize content.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Learners can seamlessly navigate between courses and chapters, following a logical learning path or jumping directly to topics of interest.
- **Modern Design**: The project uses React and related technologies to provide a responsive, intuitive user interface.

## Project Structure in React
The project follows a structured organization for scalability:
- **Screens**: Contains individual folders for each course (e.g., `Javascript`, `Python`, `C`) with subfolders for each chapter.
- **Components**: Houses reusable UI components like `Item` and `Bottom` for consistent page layout and navigation.
- **App.js**: Configures `react-router-dom` routes to handle navigation across courses and chapters.
- **Assets**: Stores images and visual elements used throughout the courses.
